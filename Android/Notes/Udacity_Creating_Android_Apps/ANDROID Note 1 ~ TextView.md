ANDROID Note 1 ~ TextView
========================

Get a reference of the textview that was created by going to the `activity_main.xml` which is a numeric identifitier `` android:id="@+id/tv_toy_names"``.  The `@` helps it to look for the contencts inside of the Android resources while the plus sign tells the tool to create the id if it doesn't yet exist and its better than referencing something like a style string or image.  

Next use textview and use `findViewById(R.id.tv_toy_names)` to find the view

The `R` class is autogenerated by the Android tool chain.  The slashes get replaced with a period because java doesn't allow slashes. 




1. Add the Id to the TextView in the layout
2. find the Id for the Textview in the MainActivity.java source
3. Append the contents of the ToyNames string array to the TextView

Use the `printf()` function.

``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

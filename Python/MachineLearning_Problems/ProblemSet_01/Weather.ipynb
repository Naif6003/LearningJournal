    "It appears there were between 3903 and 3923 flights from NYC airports to Seattle in 2013. Some of the columns are missing values for some flights, leading to different counts. I put the likely number of completed SEA-bound flights at 3903, which is the number of flights that recorded an arrival time. Based on the data, I would speculate that 3923 flights were planned, as that many have a flight number, origin, destination, year/month/day, carrier, and distance. These are all fields that would be known at the time a flight was scheduled. However, it is likely that only completed flights would record an arrival time. Therefore I put the number at 3903, and presume that 20 of the 3923 scheduled flights were cancelled for one reason or another."

While we see that, this could be unexpected as weather conditions like snow or rains during winter would have been more influential in delayed flights status. However, this observation is based off of only one year's (2013) worth of data."

    "Weather appears to have an effect on the average length of flight delays. Looking at each of Temperature, Wind Speed, Precipitation, and Visibility (the four weather measurements I selected as most interesting to analyze), we see some  relationships. Temperature has a strong relationship with departure delay length, evidenced by a visible linear pattern and a high R-squared value. In this simple linear model, temp explains 89% of the variation in dep_delay. Interestingly, the relationship is positive - higher temperature correlates with higher average delays. This is somewhat surprising, as this analyst would have expected cold temperatures to produce long delays. Wind_speed also appears to have an effect on delay length, though the pattern is not as strong. The R-squared is .79. Precipitation does not appear to be strongly related to departure delay. Visibility shows a relationship with departure delay. As expected, very low visibilities are associated with higher departure delays. For visibility >= 3 miles, there does not appear to be a significant effect on departure delay, as the line is relatively flat."
